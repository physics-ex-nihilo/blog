        <h1 id="who">who:</h1>

<p>I’m a budding apprentice in the art of physics. I’ve been studying for about nine years now. I am just now realizing how little I understand.</p>

<h1 id="what">what:</h1>

<p>This is a blog! I write about science, mostly physics. My goal is for the reader to feel like <em>they</em> could have come up with the laws of physics themselves, starting from nothing - at least in principle, if not in practice.</p>

<h1 id="why">why:</h1>

<p>Oh, lots of reasons. I’m not the first to complain about science education; perhaps the most famous example is <a href="http://gama.fizika.unios.hr/~zglumac/ZFeynmanJudgingBooks.pdf">Feynman</a>, but there are <a href="http://amasci.com/miscon/miscon.html">other examples</a> strewn about the internet.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s a matter of personal satisfaction. The way science education has usually gone is this: someone comes along with a pre-packaged body of knowledge and says “Learn this”. Now it turns out learning the rules of that package is already a difficult task. It doesn’t leave a lot of room to ask questions.</p>

<p>Suppose you do manage to ask, “how do I know these rules are true?” They’ll answer, “here’s a problem that we know the answer to. If you check the rules, you’ll see they give you the correct answer.”</p>

<p>But then, how did you know that was the answer in the first place? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">Verifying a solution is easy; finding the solution is hard.</a></p>

<p>So I set out to find answers my own way.</p>
