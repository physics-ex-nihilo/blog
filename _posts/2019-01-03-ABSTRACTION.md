excerpt: The idea of "ideas" begins with language.

At the dawn of intelligence, there is no language.

There are no words to describe sensations; only sensations. There are experiences and stories, but no storytellers yet. How do they come about? Where does the concept of a concept come from?

The idea of "ideas" begins with language, and to develop a language you might start by recognizing objects.

So, how do you go about recognizing objects?

Imagine you are walking along at night. Turning a corner, you see in the distance a figure. It's far away and in the low light hard to distinguish; is it a person, or merely a tree?

Human perception has a limited resolution, so even though a person is not the same as a tree, they might _look_ the same under certain conditions.

Once you step closer, they become easier to distinguish. Trees are often taller than people; trees usually have a blob of green at the top; people usually have four limbs and trees have many; people tend to move more than trees do.

There is an important lesson to be learned here: _objects are distinguished by their properties_. In liquistic terms you might say it another way: _nouns are distinguished by their adjectives_.

Nouns are things that you can point to, or hold in your hand, like a cup or a rock. If someone asks what an apple is, you can pick one up and show them as an example. Adjectives are trickier. You will not find a "big" roaming in the wild. There are big people, and big trees, and big apples; but there is no such thing as a "big" all by itself. The same holds for many other adjectives: there are green things, but no green; you can have five rocks or five sticks or five melons, but you cannot grasp a five with your fingers.

Yet adjectives are how we recognize nouns in the first place. A tree is green, and people are not green; that is one way to tell them apart.

Why does the label "tree" exist in the first place? Because there is a set of objects that have similar characteristics, so we lump them together under the term "tree". The key is not just noticing when objects have something in common; it's noticing when objects _almost_ have something in common.

No two trees are exactly alike, just as no two shades of green are exactly alike. But if the color of two things is close - similar enough that you might mistake one for the other at a distance, in low light, with clumsy, low-res human senses - then you can apply the same label to them.

This is not just how language is built, but many other skills as well. A drawing of a tree is not the same thing as a tree; but by recognizing the shapes that are common to trees in general, you can create an image that _looks like_ a tree, even if it isn't exactly the same as one.

And this ability - _recognizing shapes that things have in common_ - this is the power that mathematics runs on.
