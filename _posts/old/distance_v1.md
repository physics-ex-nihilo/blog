## Near and Far

Let us apply our observational skills to play a simple game. We'll call this game "_what's different_". This game will allow us to identify useful patterns in reality, which we can use to build more patterns, and so on.

Suppose you and I find a flat patch of dirt in an empty field - nothing much to look at or be distracted by, not even a cloud in the sky. There is, however, a small rock in front of you.

[image of a stick figure on the right and a rock on the left. The sun shines above.]

You close your eyes for a moment, and when you open them again I have changed something. _What's different?_

[image of a stick figure on the right. The rock is now further to the left. The sun shines above as before.]

The sky is unchanged. The grass looks pretty much the same. But something is different about the rock... What we will call this new concept?

In the first case, you might say the rock is _near_, and in the second case, the rock is _far_. By saying "_the_ rock", we mean that the rock itself is unchanged. It is the same rock in both cases, but some _other_ property of the rock is _not_ the same.

_Near_ and _far_ are not concepts that we try to define. If you didn't know what these words meant, it's hard to imagine how I could describe them to you using only words; I'd have to _show_ you what I mean.

This is merely the first step - we can improve on the concept.

## Different observers

Recall our goal: _describe as much as possible, as simply as possible, to as many  people as possible._ With this in mind, we introduce another person into the picture.

[image of two stick figures on the right and a rock on the left. Still further to the left is a tree. The sun shines above.]

Suppose you and I are standing next to each other, and you teach me what "near" and "far" mean using examples: the rock is near, and the tree is far. If you show me enough examples, then I can learn what these ideas mean.

Now let's change things slightly:

[image of a stick figures on the right and a stick figure on the left, next to the tree. The rock is closer to the right figure than the left one. The sun shines above.]

Now we are in disagreement: you say that the rock is near, I say that the rock is far. You say that the tree is far, I say that it is near. What happened? What's different?

Perhaps the problem is that _I_ am far to you, and _you_ are far to me. Before, we were near to each other. If we are far from each other, does that flip our answers? Will your "near" always be my "far", and vice versa?

Not necessarily:

[zoomed out image. far to the left is a tree. two stick figures are separated by a small distance; the rock is still closer to the right figure than the left. The sun shines above.]

Now we both agree that the tree is far, but you think the rock is near and I think the rock is far. Everything is scrambled! However, by analyzing the situation, we can start to untangle things.

I might say that the tree and the rock are both far, but their "farness" is not the same: the tree is "more far" and the rock is "less far".

Or, we could put it another way: according to you, I am near, and the rock is near; but the rock is "more near" and I am "less near". Comapred to me and the rock, the tree is even _less_ near.

Saying "more" or "less" is the same as saying that nearness and farness have _magnitude_. And magnitude is essential, because it means that we can assign _numbers_ to nearness/farness. In other words, we can ask the question _"How far?"_

In order to do this properly, you and I will have to agree on how to count farness.

## Objective farness

The discrepancy between observers becomes apparent once we try to _measure_ farness.  Here's how that might happen:

Suppose we each decide to walk to the tree, and count how many steps it took to get there (this is only a rough estimate, but it will do for now). To make sure that neither one lies about the total number of steps, we can both paint the bottoms of our feet. Then, afterwards, we can both see the path we took and count the footprints.

Perhaps a bird's eye view of the situation looks something like this:

[on the left is a tree. Extending from the tree, directly to the right, is a set of red footprints. Another set of footprints in blue extends from the tree at roughly a 45 degree angle, leaving a longer path than the red footprints]

Either by looking at the image or counting footprints, we can easily tell that the two measurements will not be in disagreement. Now, however, it is clear why: although you and I both _end_ at the tree, we do not _start_ in the same place.

Perhaps this seems obvious to you - or maybe it was even obvious from the beginning. Nonetheless, this leads to a very important rule:

_Farness is objective only if the start and end points are the same_.

That is to say: if we want to observers to agree on farness, they must first agree on where to measure farness _from_.

To avoid confusion, let's make a clear distinction. Whether something is near or far depends on the observer; something can be near to me but far to you. We usually say "the tree is near", implying that "near" is a property of the tree alone. But a tree cannot be _near_ all by itself; it must be _near_ something else.

Let's define a new word: _distance_. While near and far are subjective, distance is objective. It is defined _between_ two points. Thus, if you and I agree on those two points, we should agree on the distance between them.

I must again emphasize this (deceptively) obvious point: _distance is measured between TWO objects_. Despite its humble origins, this definition will lead to unintuitive consequences later!

Now, let us move onto some subtleties in measuring distance.

## Simple Paths

Let's return to the footprints example. Suppose that instead of taking the path above, I decided to do something like this:

[A similar image to the first one, except that the red footprints take a winding, curvy path to the tree].

Clearly, something is wonky here. But let's try to figure out exactly what and why.

One of the principles of science is _replicability_. If two people do the same thing in the same way and get the same answer, that's a useful law of science, because it's predictable. If I know what steps someone is going to perform, I can say in advance what result they'll get. Predictable events happen the same way every time; thus, describing _one_ event describes _many_.

Whenever possible, it is best to simplify. If there are multiple ways of doing something, pick the simplest way to do it.

This clarifies the problem with the curvy path. In order for you and I to agree on the red distance, I have to make sure you follow the _exact_ same twisty path that I did. Twisty paths are complicated! Why make things difficult? A much simpler way to make sure we agree is just to use a straight line.

Intuitively, this makes sense. If I ask, "which way is the tree?", you'll point to it _in a straight line_. I could describe the measurement process thusly:

> 1) Go to the starting point.

> 2) Figure out which way the ending point is.

> 3) Take one step in that direction.

> 4) Repeat steps 2 & 3 until you reach the endpoint.

There is still one major problem with this method: human error. Human sense are typically clumsy and imprecise. Just telling someone "move in a straight line" isn't a guarantee that they _will_. Using footprints introduces further inaccuracy - not everyone has the same stride, and even if you line up one foot right after the other, not everyone has the same foot size.

Let's fix these problems.


## The Rope and the Stick

Now we have an objective measurement, called "distance". To properly quantify this, we'll rely on two simple tools.

First, we need to establish a reliable way of making a straight line. One simple way to do this - at least for distances that aren't _too_ long - is with a rope.  Suppose we have two wooden stakes at points A and B. If we tie a rope around stake A, and pull it tight, it makes a straight line:

[image of a wooden stake in the ground at point A. A rope extends from point A to point B, where a stick figure is pulling the rope].

Once we've pulled it tight, we can tie it around stake B. The length of the rope between the two stakes is the distance between A and B. This also allows us to _compare_ two distances. If you have a rope between two stakes C and D, we can cut our ropes from the stakes and compare their lengths.

The method does have some shortcomings. The rope isn't perfectly accurate; its ends will fray, which introduces ambiguity, and if I wanted to compare very small distances I would have to cut the rope very precisely.

Also, the rope isn't suitable for great distances. The longer the rope is, the harder I have to pull on it to keep it straight. If the distances is _too_ long, then it requires too much strength to keep the rope taut, and the middle of the rope sags:

[image of a rope sagging under its own weight due to insufficient forces keeping it straight]

Finally, many ropes are _elastic_ to some degree - if you pull on them, they stretch. The length of the rope changes depending on how hard you pull. This makes it difficult to get a consistent measurement out of the rope.

Although using a rope to measure distances is flawed, it still provides an okay approximation, and it serves as a useful demonstration for what a straight line is. If you need to describe the concept "straight line" to someone else, you can hold up a piece of string, and pull it tight. It is something that anyone can do with anything like a rope (e.g. dental floss, charging cables, purse straps, etc).

As always, we would like to do better.

To improve on our measuring device, we want something _inflexible_, that will remain straight once we have shaped it that way; and it should be rigid, not elastic, so that it doesn't stretch or compress. As a rough estimate, a stick will serve our purposes.

First we must ensure that the stick is straight. One way to do this is to use a 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumb_bob">plumb bob</a>): tie something heavy to one end of a string, and let it hang. That will make a vertical line. Then we can gather sticks and compare them to the vertical line, picking the straightest out of the bunch.

Next, we'll use a technique called "sighting". If you hold the stick up to your eye and look down its length, it's possible for you to spot deviations from perfect straightness. If you have a sharp tool handy, you can shave off the pieces that "stick out".

[image demonstrating sighting a straight line; top view vs. line-of-sight view]

The skill takes practice. One way to tell whether you're doing it right is to lay two sticks next to each other. If they rest against each other without any gaps, then they're shaped the same.

## A digression: Lines

First, how do we find the line? Can I give somebody instructions to make their own line in the real world? Yes: look to the hanging vine, look to the rope pulled taut. There, you find a line.

This also connects nicely to our concept of distance. If I pick two points and tie a rope between them, I always use _more_ rope if it's not pulled tight. Pulling the rope tight (with nothing else in the way) ensures that I use the least amount of rope.

This is sort of a physical way of demonstrating that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

We _could_ in principle use some other arbitrary curve - I can draw whatever squiggle I like between two points. However, a line has a couple of advantages.

First, as demonstrated above, I can give anybody instructions for how to make a line. Suppose I pull a rope tight between two trees, then cut the rope to exactly the distance between the two trees. If you independently do the same thing, and we compare ropes, the lengths should just about match.

On the other hand, if I lay out the rope in a random curve between the two trees, it's much harder to describe to you. In order for us to get ropes that are the same length, I would have to give a much longer, more detailed description of how to lay out your rope.

Remember: one of our goals is to say as much as possible, as simply as possible. A line is simpler than other curves.

Let's examine this simplicity in more detail, a little more abstractly. First, I imagine that we understand two concepts:

> Sameness, or _congruence_: you can recognize when two things are the same, or when two shapes would "overlap" perfectly.

> Scaling, or _similarity_: you can recognize when one thing is a smaller copy of another thing (or vice versa, when another thing is a bigger copy of one thing)

The shape of a line is special with respect to these two concepts.

If I take a piece of the line, and compare it to any other piece, the two parts match up: they are congruent. This isn't true for other shapes, for example an ellipse. If you cut out a piece of the ellipse and hold it up to some other part of the ellipse, the two parts won't match. I'll call this property "self-congruent".

Every part of a line is the same as every other part of a line; so I only have to tell you about one part - any one part - and you know what the rest is shaped like. That makes it simpler than some random curve.

But this property isn't _quite_ unique: a circle is also self-congruent. For a perfectly circular piece, the crust of any slice overlaps exactly with the crust of any other slice. Unlike a circle, however, a line is also "self-similar": if you take a piece of the line, and _scale it_ - make it bigger or smaller - it _still_ matches up perfectly with any other part of the line. Circles don't do this.

Not all circles are the same; you can tell the difference between a big circle and a small circle. On the other hand, every line is just a piece of every other line.

We still need one more property in order to uniquely define the line. A line is not the _only_ shape that is self-congruent and self-similar: a _flat plane_ also has these properties. Cut some blob out of a flat piece of paper, and it matches up with any other part of the paper. That's self-congruence (and you could play the same game with the surface of a globe). If you imagine growing or shrinking the blob from a flat sheet of paper, it will again match up with any other part of the paper. That's self-similarity.

However, if I want two pieces of paper to be the same - if I wanted to give you some instructions to make sure we both make the same shape - I have to give you two more pieces of information. You need to know the length and width of the paper.

A piece of paper has _two_ dimensions, whereas a line has only _one_ dimension. If I want us to meet up with two ropes of the same length, I only have to tell you one number. So that is simpler than a flat plane.

To put it another way, _distance_ is a property that only requires one number: how far away is A from B? A line has one number associated with it, and it is the simplest shaped curve (being self-congruent and self-similar). A piece of paper has two number associated with it - what would we do with the extra number? It's redundant, it doesn't help our description of distances.

If a part of your description isn't useful, doesn't _do_ anything, then throw it out. It makes your explanation longer for no good reason, and we want to describe things _as simply as possible_.

So distances are defined between two objects: pull a rope tight between them, and measure the rope. Let's now design a measuring tool for distance.


>More ideas: a finite flat object is defined by its boundary; cannot use "single parameter" idea because a disk is self-similar, self-congruent, and defined by a single parameter. Dimensionality is difficult to use because it introduces direction, which is hard to define without orthogonality, which requires lines... In general the "length and width" trick doesn't work because what if they're the same??

>Planes also have a rotational degree of symmetry (any blob can be _rotated_ and overlaps with any other blob; but so does a circle (although a line doesn't). However, rotation requires us to specify a rotational axis, which requires lines.

>Careful about open vs. closed surfaces - any self-congruent closed surface is defined by a single parameter! Defining length is also tricky since the boundary point is arbitrary, unlike a line segment which has clearly defined boundaries.

>Alternative idea: people natural recognize "what direction" something is in; they can point to where it is. This already defines a line... but you can get into trouble moving along curved surfaces. Presumably if the surface is "sufficiently curved" you'd still _point_ in a straight line to the object, but you wouldn't move in a straight line to it.

>Falling objects move in a straight line.

>SAMENESS as an important concept: the brain sees a thing, stores it, then sees the same thing; i.e. identical stimulus twice (to within machine resolution) IE some part of the brain machine must end up in the same state twice.

>I've cheated a bit by using the idea of rope; in truth, directionality probably helps define what a straight line is first... my point is that I can't guarantee that you could communicate a line to aliens if they don't invent rope. Is rope a universal?

>Focus on humans. Here's the solution: for a bounded surface, you need to specify the _shape_ of the boundary. You don't have to do that for a line. So it's the "simplest" self-congruent, self-symmetric shape. If I tell you those two facts and that the solution should be defined _only_ by those two facts, I think that produces a line.

>>You still run into a problem with unbounded surfaces - like the "plane" of the Earth. It has no obvious boundary shape... but since ultimately we're trying to measure distances between two things, you need a bounded shape to perform measurements, something in your hand. So I think this suffices.
