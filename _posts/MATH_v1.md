One definition of physics is to recognize patterns in reality, and describe them. _Recognizing patterns_ here just means finding things that are the same. In the last post, I made the case that this is a broad ability, with its roots in language but extending to art and science as well.

So we would like to look at reality, see what is the same, and describe this sameness. Of course, to describe things we will need a language, and the language of physics is math. In a sense, that is what math was _invented_ for: to describe specific types of patterns in nature.

In the same sense, you could say words were invented to communicate between humans - but that's not all they're used for nowadays. We have things like song and poetry, which are quite different from sending a message from one person to another. You could say it's still communication, but of a different sort.

The story is likewise with mathematics. Although first invented to describe reality, it eventually branched out and became its own thing. It turns out that math can have its _own_ patterns, separate from the patterns in nature. Unlike physicists, many mathematicians aren't even _thinking_ about nature when they do their work.

A mathematician has rigor.  They examine every assumption, taking careful, incremental steps with airtight reasoning the entire way.

A good physicist knows the math, but is more concerned with the ability to make predictions.  If a theory successfully tells you what will happen next, a physicist might not care about all of the details below the surface.  Furthermore, they may criticize the mathematicians for developing arbitrarily abstract notions that have no connection to the physical world.

But the mathematician at this stage can point out that more often than not, when physicists have an idea about the physical world, the mathematicians have already invented the math for it - without even knowing or caring about the physical problem it relates to.  And physicists, being less careful than mathematicians, might come up with patterns that are only true in special cases. Such a faulty pattern will fail to make good predictions in other cases - the type of mistake a mathematician is less likely to make.

(And then, there's an oft-repeated joke that what theoretical physicists discover will only be useful to the engineers fifty years later.  Take quantum mechanics, for example.  It was a stupendously accurate theory that had a stupendous lack of practical applications at the time it was created.  Now, it's the basis of the technology in nearly every device we have. The engineers are fifty years behind the physicists, and the physicists are fifty years behind the mathematicians.  That said, the smartest mathematician in 1900 couldn't have built you an iPhone no matter how much math they knew.)

In order to do physics, you must be prepared to do math. But _inventing_ the math, seeing how it works at the same deep level that we want for the physics, is extremely difficult. What is a line? What is counting? These things are intuitive and easy to overlook because we were taught them as children. To _think_ of lines or counting in the first place is an incredible feat, and to rigorously prove them doubly so.

Thus, for the time being, I will rely a little bit on that mathematical intuition we receive as children. While I will closely examine concepts like distance and motion, I won't do the same for the math used to describe them.  There may someday be a "math ex nihilo"... but alas, now is not the time.  For now, we will leave math to the mathematicians.
