You will find no lines in nature; never will you encounter an infinite plane or a perfect triangle. But look at the hanging vine; look at the rope pulled taut, and blur your vision, imagine seeing at a distance in low light. There you will find the line. Not in nature, but in the power of human intelligence to look at nature and reduce it to its parts; to ask which parts are similar to which others; and to pull abstract patterns from hard reality.
