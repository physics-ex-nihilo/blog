Stephen Hawking asked, in his Brief History of Time, "What do we know about the universe, and how do we know it?"  I'd like to probe the meaning of this question further with three anecdotes from my time as a physics TA. These stories outline a revelation I had about what it means to learn and understand the laws of physics.

## The Lightbulbs

The first flash of realization came in a lab I had taught many times before - Intro to Electricity and Magnetism. The idea behind the class was to for the students to see physical laws in action, and gain a better appreciation for them. (I am dubious the class achieved this goal - but more on that later).

A standard exercise in the lab was to give the students a conceptual problem at before the experiment, to get them to think scientifically and familiarize them with concepts. The day of my first realization, the question went like this:

>"Two lightbulbs _A_ and _B_ are connected in series to a battery. Which lightbulb is brighter?"

First, let me comment on this with the knowledge I have now.

How are students supposed to answer this question? If you had never seen two lightbulbs in series - or if you didn't know what 'series' means - how could you be expected to answer? There are basic principles of circuits you could use to arrive at the solution; but what if you had never been taught those principles?

And where do those principles _come from_ anyways? As far as a student is concerned, they are handed down as gospel. The professor says "x is true", so you believe x. How did the professor get them? From some other, older professor? Where, then, does the knowledge come from in the first place?

My point is that it is _unreasonable_ to expect a student to arrive at the answer without:

>a) Actually _looking_ at lightbulbs and observing their properties and patterns

>b) _Knowing_ what to look for in the first place; what _types_ of observations will lead you to the correct answer.

But back to the story.

As I went around the class asking students to share their reasoning, I came across a group who said something like this: "We've decided that A is brigher than B; now we're just trying to figure out _why_ that's the case."

If this does not apall you, I encourage you to pause and think about it; to try to see the flaw and how serious it is.

The students were essentially picking between three possibilities: A>B, B>A, or A=B. The students of Group One had decided A>B. My question to them was: "What made you _decide_ that in the first place?"

At first they didn't understand the question. They proceeded with their original plan, trying to come up with reasons _after_ the fact. They had chosen their answer, and they were working to rationalize it. What I wanted to know was what _made_ them think of _that_ answer in the first place, _instead_ of deciding the answer was one of the other possibilities.

Clearly something had nudged them towards A>B. Something had inspired them to move in that direction first. However, for whatever reason, they _skipped over_ that initial impetus, ignored it, and tried to come up with something more "scientific".

## "E pur si muove"

This is a lecture I would give to students in an Astronomy class I taught.

Step 1: Dance and waggle your arms around all weird, and ask, "Am I moving?"

The response to this (amid some laughter) is usually yes. Next step: ask, "How do you know I am moving?"

Students can easily overthink this one, but the simple answer is sufficient: they use their eyes and can see when things are moving.

Okay, so what if you were blind? Could you still tell if I were moving? Sure; you can usually hear when something is moving, and if not, you can feel it moving - either by the breeze as it passes by, or by stickin' your fingers on whatever's moving and feel it move.

All right then: Based on these things only, does the Earth move?

And you would be amazed! You would be aghast (I hope) at how many people _still_ say _yes_!

So you bust out a _final_ question: If the Earth is moving, how do you know? Can you see it moving? Can you hear it moving? Can you feel it moving? And if not, then _why_ did you think it was?

Probably because somebody 'important' told you it was, and you were gullible enough to believe them.

Say you grew up without someone telling you the Earth was moving, and then when you were older someone suggested the idea. If you stopped to think about it, it would sound nuts! The Earth _moves_?

What would even make you _think of that idea in the first place_?

## Electrons

When I got my first degree in physics, I thought I had some _ideas_ about physics.

One of these ideas was electrons. I _believed in_ electrons - ya know, thought they existed and all. If anyone had ever asked me for proof, I would slam my open hand down on the table, and say, "See that? The force you feel pushing up from the table is because electrons."

Yeah... it turns out that isn't even correct.

But that's not the issue. The issue is: I didn't believe in electrons _because_ someone smacked a table and said, "See? Electrons." I believed in electrons because _somebody important told me they were true_, and I was gullible enough to believe them. Then, after the fact, I came up with plausible-sounding, 'scientific' reasons for why they should be.

A few years later, I was expressing frustration about physics education to a fellow student. I said that I wanted to _see_ phyiscs with my own eyes. I wanted to know what it is you look at in the world to make you come up with the laws of physics before anyone else has thought of them.

The student responded that such a philosophy doesn't always work in practice. For example, you can't see electrons with your own eyes.

And it took me a couple of days to realize that was completely the wrong way to think about it. At some point before anyone had thought of electrons, someone must have _seen something_, with their _own eyes_, to make them say, "Hey! I'm going to call that an electron". Someone must have looked at reality and recognized a pattern that no one else had seen, and thus there was no name for. So they named that pattern "electron." _This is what I wish to see_. The _original_ pattern.

Science is hard.  Really, really hard.  The stuff we take for granted is especially hard, and once you realize that, you start to notice that it's some kind of goddamned miracle that anybody figured it out in the first place.

You, however, have an advantage.  As Newton said: "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."  People have come before.  They figured out this knowledge, and laid out a path for us.

This is not infallible, however! The first scientists did not always take the _best_ path; they didn't know what questions to ask, and were blinded by bias and emotional ties to incorrect answers.  They often explored paths that led nowhere but dead-ends, or paths that _seemed_ like the right answer until someone cleverer came along.

I'm not particularly interested in revisiting all the mistakes made in the past.  Occasionally I will throw in a historical tidbit, because it's interesting.  That said, I see no reason to spend 2000 years believing the Earth is at the center of the universe, or that the stars are made of aether. Or whatever.

Instead, I wish to cut across the garbage and make use of the most efficient route to truth.

My goals are:
>a) You should _see_ where the laws of physics came from: what you would do to demonstrate or discover it.

>b) You should _feel_ like the laws are correct.

>c) You should _feel_ like you actually understand the physics.

What makes it science is the ability to _predict patterns_ and, if only in principle, that anyone could verify those patterns are correct. Otherwise, you're just repeating words that somebody else told you were "true".

My starting point for this journey is to examine the laws you would learn in an introductory mechanics course, and in a way consistent with the three ideals above.

To get this effect, I'm going to imagine someone living back at the beginning, before the laws were created. This won't be a true historical account - our idealized scientist will always have a knack for asking the right questions and using the correct tools; they have the time and resources to build a testing apparatus for every experiment they like.  What they lack is the knowledge - you can't just say to them "The Earth moves!"  They simply won't believe you.  You have to prove it.

And I want to do this without using futuretech.  While you can get at the laws of gravity much more easily using your phone's stopwatch and camera, is it possible to build a phone without knowing the laws of gravity?  How does the stopwatch in your phone work?  How do you even know it's measuring time accurately?  What does "accurately" mean?

With these things in mind, let's begin.
