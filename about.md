# who:

I'm a budding apprentice in the art of physics. I've been studying for about nine years now. I am just now realizing how little I understand. 

# what:

This is a blog! I write about science, mostly physics. My goal is for the reader to feel like _they_ could have come up with the laws of physics themselves, starting from nothing - at least in principle, if not in practice.

# why:

Oh, lots of reasons. I'm not the first to complain about science education; perhaps the most famous example is <a href="http://gama.fizika.unios.hr/~zglumac/ZFeynmanJudgingBooks.pdf">Feynman</a>, but there are <a href="http://amasci.com/miscon/miscon.html">other examples</a> strewn about the internet.

Maybe it's a matter of personal satisfaction. The way science education has usually gone is this: someone comes along with a pre-packaged body of knowledge and says "Learn this". Now it turns out learning the rules of that package is already a difficult task. It doesn't leave a lot of room to ask questions.

Suppose you do manage to ask, "how do I know these rules are true?" They'll answer, "here's a problem that we know the answer to. If you check the rules, you'll see they give you the correct answer."

But then, how did you know that was the answer in the first place? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">Verifying a solution is easy; finding the solution is hard.</a>

So I set out to find answers my own way.
