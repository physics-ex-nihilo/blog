title: physics ex nihilo.

  <h1>welcome.</h1>
    <p>This is a blog where I talk about physics, namely: if <em>you yourself</em> had to rediscover the laws of physics, how would you do it? What experiments would you need to perform, what patterns would you need to notice?</p>
	
	<p>As part of the discussion, I'll make a case for what I think the art of physics <em>really</em> entails. For an intro to my thoughts on this, check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}">about</a> page. Or, for a longer exposition, see my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-01-PHYSICS %}">first post</a>.</p>
